                <p>Kyoto is the cultural heart of Japan, home of thousands of temples, shrines, and palaces, making it one of the top travel destinations for foreign tourists and locals. Fushimi Inari Taisha is one of the more prominent shrines, located in the southern part of Kyoto on Mount Inari.</p>

                <p>The shrine is originally linked to the Hata family, who were believed to have brought silk production to Japan. They founded the shrine in order to preserve the gods of rice and sake production, which were vital industries in early agricultural age.</p>

                <p>Legend says, Irogu no Hatanokimi of the Hata clan shot an arrow with a rice cake on it into the air and it turned into a swan, flew away, eventually landing on the peak of the mountain where rice grew. This lead to the beginning of worshiping Inari Okami, the god of rice, and the start of the Fushimi Inari Taisha.</p>

                <p>The first structures date back to 711 AD on Inariyama hill. Ancient writings dictate that Irogu no Hatanokimi received an imperial order from Empress Genmei to enshrine 3 deities on 3 mountains on the first Day of the Horse of the 2nd month of the year 711. That year the farmers were blessed with great harvests, grains, and silk.</p>

                <p>"The Inari Great Rite is held on the first day of the horse in February, a date that marks both the legendary founding of the shrine and the start of rice-planting. All other rites are related to the rice harvest and/or to the flourishing of commerce. Highlights include the commerce rite (sangyosai) in April, and the Inari rite, which straddles April and May. Then there are celebrations of rice-planting in June, rice-plucking in October, and rice-harvesting in November; they are known as the taue, nukiho, and niiname rites respectively” (Breen, John, and Mark Teeuwen. “A New History of Shinto.” A New History of Shinto, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, West Sussex, 2010, p. 213).</p>

                <p>Imperial messengers started visiting the shrine after the Emperor presented offerings in return for rain for bountiful crops. Fushimi Inari Taisha moved from Nagaoka to Kyoto in 794 when the capital moved.</p>

                <p>During the Heian period (794-1185) the Emperor became sick from what was thought to be a curse by the deity due to cutting down sacred trees on Inariyama mountain  in order to build the 5-story Pagoda of Toji Temple. To appease the gods, Fushimi Inari Taisha was made into a shrine of higher status, which made it much more popular with the common people.</p>

                <p>In 1336, Emperor Godaigo flees Kyoto and loses his way. He prays to the god Inari to lead him to safety, and recites a poem that symbolize three mountains, including Fushimi Inari Taisha, which are considered sacred land.</p>

                <p>1467 marks the beginning of the Onin Rebellion. On March 21, 1468 (during the Muromachi period), the shrines were burned down in a fire during an attack of the Onin Civil War.</p>

                <p>Due to destruction from fire and natural causes, most of the remaining structures are from the 15th century. The main shrine was built in 1499 and is now considered one of the most important landmarks to Japan’s culture and history.</p>

                <p>In 1589, a well known samurai named Toyotomi Hideyoshi built the main gate of Fushimi Inari Taisha. During the Edo period (1603-1868), Fushimi Inari Taisha started to become popular with merchants, dramatically improving faith throughout Japan.</p>

                <p>Between 1871 - 1946, Fushimi Inari Taisha held the rank of kanpei-taisha, making it the top government supported shrine under the State Shinto system. 2011 marks the 1300th anniversary of the shrine’s establishment.</p>

                <p>This historical landmark gained a lot of attention after being introduced in many films such as Memoirs of a Geisha. Fushimi Inari Taisha is the main location for all Inari Shinto shrines.</p>

                <p>Fushimi Inari Taisha features a myriad of under 10,000 torii, which are vermillion (Shuiro in Japanese) colored gates. This color, which happens to be the color of the sun, symbolizes the abundance of crops and the god Inari. In some areas the concentration of gates is only centimeters apart, creating beautiful colors during sunrise and sunset. These torii tunnel visitors into the forest of Mount Inari, pathing several hours worth of climbing by foot. All areas, not just shrines, are considered sacred.</p>

                <p>Normally, torri represent where a god exists, but Fushimi has them all over the place, representing a gateway or path to which dreams come true.</p>

                <p>“The torii gate of a shinto shrine is similarly a signal of change - a threshold from one place to another. In this case, the threshold marks the boundary of the sacred space of a shinto shrine in relationship to the world outside of it. A torii has no door and does not serve as a physical barrier. Yet, when one walks through a torii, whether human-scaled like many of the torii which march up the hillside behind the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto or grand like at the Ise Shrine, the passage through marks a change in attitude” (Locher, Mira, et al. “Traditional Japanese Architecture: an Exploration of Elements and Forms.” Traditional Japanese Architecture: an Exploration of Elements and Forms, Tuttle, Tokyo, 2010, p. 157).</p>

                <p>None of these gates were built by the shrine. They were all donated by businesses and people as to have their wish come true, or for gratitude because it was fulfilled. The gates have the name of the person and the date it was donated written in black.</p>

                <p>Because there are too many to clean by the employees themselves, the visitors, nearby staff and the community pitch in cleaning them too. Rest stops are available for climbers to recuperate and visit gift shops, eat food, and experience an amazing view of Kyoto.</p>

                <p>“It takes shape differently for each pilgrim, depending on the particular route followed through the dense mountain of symbols. It may be that there was in the past one or more coherent narrative, which has eroded over time from a rice rite of spiritual passage to a test of physical stamina in which the doing is emphasized more than the meaning” (Smyers, Karen A. “Inari Pilgrimage: Following One's Path on the Mountain.” Inari Pilgrimage: Following One's Path on the Mountain, p. 427).</p>

                <p>“Fushimi-Inari and the ubiquitous roadside dosojin shrines typically express the cultivation of numinous presence and aura in both Japanese Shinto and paganism more universally” (York, Michael. “Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion.” Pagan Theology: Paganism as a World Religion, New York University Press, New York, 2005, p. 28).</p>

                <p>After passing the first set of parallel Senbon Torii (thousands of torii gates), visitors are greeted with 2 stone lanterns with Omokaro Ishi placed on each. Visitors make a wish at the lanterns and try to lift the stone on one of the lanterns. If it is lighter than they expected, their wish will be granted.</p>

                <p>This Shinto shrine is open 24 hours a day. To avoid crowds, visitors may choose to come during the off season and/or during the night to have a less congested and eerie yet fascinating experience. Aside from being inhabited by many cats and spiders, Fushimi Inari Taisha contains many sculptures of white foxes. These foxes are the guardians and messengers of the shrines, and they communicate our wishes to the god Inari. Because Inari is the god of prosperity and agriculture, and rats devour crops, foxes are the natural enemy of rats and help protect such businesses and help farmers.</p>

                <p>Foxes (Kitsune in Japanese) are beloved animals in Japanese folklore. “The Fox of Shinoda” is a story about a fox that takes the form of a beautiful woman, marries a man, and gives birth to a historical figure, Abe no Seimei. Kitsune no yomeiri (fox wedding) refers to many things that are peculiar phenomena, such as rain falling from a clear sky. Fried tofu sometimes referred to as O-Inari-san or Inarizushi are favorite foods of foxes. According to legends, foxes are intelligent and possess magical abilities that increase with age and wisdom. The more tails a fox has (up to 9) the older, wiser, and more powerful it is.</p>

                <p>People give offerings to them as a deity. Fox shrines have symbolic items in their mouth or paw such as a jewel and key, sheaf of rice, a scroll, or a fox cub. Fox shrines are usually found in pairs of male and female, and all of these statues have unique characteristics even though they look the same. The shrine offers fox votive tablets where visitors may write their name and wish on, and share it on a wall with others in hopes that their wish will come true.</p>

                <p>The god Inari, also known as Ukanomitama, is the god of gains, agriculture, and abundant crops, especially rice, as it represents stable income. People pray to Inari for a good harvest. She is known for the success of business, promoting manufacturing, agriculture, and trade.</p>

                <p>Fushimi Inari Taisha is the head shrine of Inari. She is one of the most popular gods in Japanese culture. There are more than 30,000 Inari shrines in Japan, which represent more than a third of all Japanese shrines.</p>

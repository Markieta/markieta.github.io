                <p><q>"The Inari Great Rite is held on the first day of the horse in February, a date that marks both the legendary founding of the shrine and the start of rice-planting. All other rites are related to the rice harvest and/or to the flourishing of commerce. Highlights include the commerce rite (sangyosai) in April, and the Inari rite, which straddles April and May. Then there are celebrations of rice-planting in June, rice-plucking in October, and rice-harvesting in November; they are known as the taue, nukiho, and niiname rites respectively"</q> (Breen, John, and Mark Teeuwen. <q>"A New History of Shinto."</q> A New History of Shinto, Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, West Sussex, 2010, p. 213).</p>

                <p><q>"The torii gate of a shinto shrine is similarly a signal of change - a threshold from one place to another. In this case, the threshold marks the boundary of the sacred space of a shinto shrine in relationship to the world outside of it. A torii has no door and does not serve as a physical barrier. Yet, when one walks through a torii, whether human-scaled like many of the torii which march up the hillside behind the Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto or grand like at the Ise Shrine, the passage through marks a change in attitude"</q> (Locher, Mira, et al. <q>"Traditional Japanese Architecture: an Exploration of Elements and Forms."</q> Traditional Japanese Architecture: an Exploration of Elements and Forms, Tuttle, Tokyo, 2010, p. 157).</p>

                <p><q>"It takes shape differently for each pilgrim, depending on the particular route followed through the dense mountain of symbols. It may be that there was in the past one or more coherent narrative, which has eroded over time from a rice rite of spiritual passage to a test of physical stamina in which the doing is emphasized more than the meaning"</q> (Smyers, Karen A. <q>"Inari Pilgrimage: Following One's Path on the Mountain."</q> Inari Pilgrimage: Following One's Path on the Mountain, p. 427).</p>
